Part 2: Slowest Three Pages
---------------------------

Building on top of Part 1, we want to add an extra feature.

This time, we want to get the slowest combined 3-page
traversal speed, broken down by the total amount of
time taken, the path (via page IDs) and the user that
performed the page traversals.

Same as the previous step, each consecutive page of 3 are
considered a separate path.

Output should answer this question:
"Which 3-page path is the slowest (how slow?), and which
user was impacted?"

Retain the functionality of your code to answer Part 1.
