Part 1: The Most Common Three-Page Path
---------------------------------------

The input files (input1.csv and input2.csv) represent
simplified access logs. The first column is a timestamp.
The second column is a customer ID. The third column is
a page ID. The fourth column is the page's load time in
milliseconds.

Log entries within a file are always ordered by timestamp.

Given a file like this, calculate the most common
"3-page path" through the site. The most common path is
across all users. Users can visit a path multiple times.
When they visit more than three pages, consider each
consecutive page of 3 as a separate path: meaning, if they
visit pages P1 - P4, then there are 2 paths:
1) P1, P2, P3
2) P2, P3, P4

Choose any sensible output that answers this question:
"What is the most common 3 page path, and how many times
was it visited?"
